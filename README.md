# Technoxian-Line-Follower
Made a Line Follower for the Fastest Line Follower Competition; made the bot using IR Sensor Array (8 IR Sensors), Arduino Uno, L293N Motor Driver and an 11.1V Lipo Battery
Arduino Code involves taking IR Sensor Readings and combining it to make a binary code which is used as the key to a switch for different cases to execute different types of turns
